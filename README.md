# Self Review and Future Improvements
1. Implement different levels of user:<br>
Open - no log in for viewing projects<br>
Visitor - log in to comment or like anyone's projects but no editing<br>
Owner - log in to create, edit, delete, share/download own projects<br>
<br>
2. Add other reactions - love it, curious, etc<br>
<br>
3. Modify 'like' so that visitor can only use one like per project - maybe implement a toggle action.<br>
Don't allow owners to react to own projects<br>
<br>
4. Allow own projects to be downloaded as PDFs for sharing with recruiters<br>
<br>
5. Amend the comments to be shown only underneath the associated projects<br>
Implement profanity, etc checks if possible<br>
<br>
6. Allow viewers to view projects of a particular owner<br>
<br>
7. Modify the UI in line with current standards.<br>
<br>
8. Make the app mobile friendly<br>
